# Blackjack
This is my first longer program, a text-based blackjack game created for a prompt in the Udemy course I'm doing on python.

To try it, run the script e.g. in command line on Windows. Navigate to file location then type "python [file name]".

You can open it in Sublime text or other text editor to check the code first.

If you notice any issues, you can let me know at kelemendavidkrisztian@gmail.com.
